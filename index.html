<p>Hey, my name is Michael Walden. I'm a senior at <a href="https://www.txstate.edu/" target="_blank">Texas State University</a>. I'm studying digital media innovation. In my free time, I love playing video games with friends. My favorite food is Chinese food, especially sesame chicken.</p>

<p>I recently tried out for a position on the Texas State <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" target="_blank">League of Legends</a> esports team. I've always enjoyed playing games competitively. Furthermore, it would be a unique experience to be able to play for my school. I'm very hopeful about my chances of making the team and getting to compete against other schools. Here's a list of some of my other favorite games.</p>

<ul>
<li>Super Smash Bros. Melee</li>
<li>Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door</li>
<li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
<li>Super Mario 64</li>
<li>Halo 3</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides playing video games, I always enjoy learning new things. Lately, I've been interested in learning how to dance. One of my favorite musical artists is Michael Jackson, and watching his dancing abilities gave me inspiration to get better at it myself. I think it would be really fun to be able to do his whole dance to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3t9-kf7ZNA" target="_blank">"Billie Jean"</a> where he did his first iconic moonwalk. The first time he did it, the crowd screamed in excitement. Here are some of my other favorites in music.</p>
