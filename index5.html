<h1>High School Marching Band</h1>

<p>In high school, I did concert and marching band. It was, without a doubt, one of the best experiences of my life. While I mentioned that I made close friends through Melee, the majority of my closest friends to this day were made through marching band. While I did enjoy concert band, marching band was where I made all the best memories and had the best times. It's incredibly challenging, but that's part of why it was so special. Being outside for hours in the heat after and before school, moving all over the field while still playing music with my peers at a high level is something I'll never forget.</p>

<p>Starting at the end of July each summer and going into the fall, everyone in band would work together to put together a show. We'd have to memorize hundreds of movements, along with unique choreography, all while playing difficult music together. It's a long and intense process, but I'd give anything to be able and do it again just one more time. Once we had enough of our show put together, we would perform at football games (as well as play fun tunes in the stands), and perform our show at competitions most weekends. The band community became my second family due to the hours we spent together, and I loved every second of it.</p>

<p>I decided to not do band in college. This decision was mostly due to the facts that I wanted to make sure I wasn't overloaded with work, since band takes a lot of time and energy, as well as there not being competitions in the college band programs. However, I will always hold the memories and friends I made through high school band close to me. My 2 best friends to this day I met freshman year of high school in summer band. The crazy thing is that I almost didn't enroll in high school band, but I'll always be thankful that I did because I never looked back.</p>
