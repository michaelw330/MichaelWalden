<h1>Super Smash Bros. Melee</h1>

<p>Super Smash Bros. Melee or "Melee" is a party game released by Nintendo in 2001, and it's my favorite game of all time. I've played it since I was a kid with my brother and friends. Not only that, but it's the game that got me into playing games competitively. It's designed to be a casual party game, which it's great for, but it also has many hidden aspects that make it fantastic as a competitive fighting game.

<p>Despite the game's age and having 3 sequals, the game still has a thriving community and competitve scene. For the biggest tournaments, players travel and enter to compete in order to see who's the best. I've met some of the game's professional players and made some great friends from going to tournaments too. I even used to play on the Texas Tech esports team for Melee when I still attended Texas Tech University. I made several close friends whom I still talk to and play with, despite transferring to a different college.</p>

<p> Unfortunately, Melee was made before playing games online was possible. However, through the passion of the community, people have made it possible to play together online on a computer. This has made the community even closer and more connected since it's no longer necessary to be in the same room to play with your friends. It makes me happy to see so many people who still enjoy the game enough to push technology in order make the playing experience better and more accessible. I can't wait to see what's left in store for Melee.
