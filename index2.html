<p>Michael Jackson is one of the most influential cultural figures of the 20th Century. Deemed "The King of Pop" his music was and still is loved by many across the world. He started his music career when he was just 5 years old, with The Jackson 5. By 13, Jackson had started his solo career as well. Jackson's solo career really heated up with his album "Off the Wall," launching him to mainstream success.</p>

<p>Michael Jackson's "Thriller" album skyrocketed him to being an international superstar. His solo performance of "Billie Jean" was responsible for his first Emmy nomination. As mentioned on my homepage, this performance was the first time Jackons did his Iconic moonwalk. And what I find so interesting is that he didn't tell his choreographers that he was going to do it. He decided to do it on his own and it instantly became an iconic dance move and part of the performance of "Billie Jean" going forward.</p>

<p>I'm very interested in learning to dance and Jackson is the main inspiration for me. Even when he's performing solo, I feel completely captivated in watching his every move. The way he moves his body is unlike anything I've seen. The level of passion he had for his craft is something that I strive for. He certainly earned the title "The King of Pop."</p>
